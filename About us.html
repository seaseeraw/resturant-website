        <h1>About us</h1>
        <h3>n ambitious wine bar and Mediterranean restaurant from the Swillhouse crew, housed in the former Phillip’s Foote restaurant in the Rocks.A swordfish rib eye comes out rightfully demanding attention, the bone slightly charred, the steak coated in a luscious and vinegary tomato picante that has a slight kick of chilli. The flesh is tender and juicy, and it's the best swordfish we’ve had.</h3>
